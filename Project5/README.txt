Q1) For which communication(s) do you use the SSL encryption?
    (4) -> (5): Must be encrypted because the user submits their credit card numbers to the server
    (5) -> (6): Must be encrypted because the server returns the credit card numbers to be displayed on the confirmation page.
    These must be encrypted because a malicious hacker could listen to these communications and steal credit card numbers.

Q2) How do you ensure that the item was purchased exactly at the Buy_Price of that particular item?
